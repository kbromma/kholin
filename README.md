# Wolf Stack

Wolf stack is a conglomeration of packages to help ease the set up of any experiment. There will be dev configurations using jest, babel, and prettier

# Install

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Recommended is LTS and node > 8 was used to create Wolfbot.

After installing Node, I recommend installing [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It is a package manager similar to npm but is faster.
